# Final Presentation  
### Gasoline Prices Increase – CS 668 Capstone Project  
---

## Slide 1 — Title
**Gasoline Prices Increase: An Analytical Study**  
*CS 668 Capstone Project – Monica Hawkins*  
*Pace University, NY, USA*

---

## Slide 2 — Introduction
Retail gasoline prices are primarily affected by:
- Crude oil prices (largest driver)
- Available gasoline supply vs. demand
- Refinery operations and capacity
- Seasonal demand fluctuations (spring/summer increases)

**Key Insight:** Prices rise when supply decreases relative to demand, and can fluctuate rapidly with disruptions in crude oil, refinery operations, or pipeline deliveries.

---

## Slide 3 — Business Problem
**Seasonal Price Volatility Challenge:**
- Gasoline prices spike in spring/summer
- Heating oil demand increases in winter
- Prices can fluctuate despite stable crude oil

**Research Goal:** Determine whether adjusting refinery operations based on seasonal patterns could help stabilize fuel costs and reduce price spikes.

---

## Slide 4 — Research Questions
1. **What drives gasoline price changes?** - Identify key predictive factors
2. **How do seasonal trends affect pricing?** - Spring/summer vs. winter patterns
3. **Can we predict price increases?** - Build ML model for extreme price surges

---

## Slide 5 — Data Sources & Preparation
**Primary Data Source:**
- U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
- U.S. Natural Gas Prices dataset

**Data Features:**
- Monthly price data (February, March, April, May, June, July)
- 11 price categories (imports, exports, pipeline, residential, industrial)
- 12 entries in training set, 3 in test set

**Data Challenges:**
- Missing values across multiple columns
- Mixed data types (object and float64) requiring conversion

---

## Slide 6 — Methodology
**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Missing value assessment
- Statistical descriptions (mean, std, min, max)

**Analysis Techniques:**
- Correlation analysis (heatmap visualization)
- Pairplot analysis for relationships
- Distribution analysis by category
- Categorical price comparisons

**Modeling Approach:**
- Machine learning model development
- Price prediction for extreme surges
- Seasonal trend forecasting

---

## Slide 7 — Key Findings

**Finding 1: Weak Linear Correlations**
- Correlation between monthly prices (Feb, May, Jul) < 0.4
- Price in one month is NOT a strong predictor of another month
- Suggests external factors drive price changes, not just historical prices

**Finding 2: Category-Based Variation**
- **TAD category** shows highest natural gas prices in February
- Significant price variation across 11 different categories
- Some categories show concentrated low-value prices; others have wide range

**Finding 3: Seasonal Price Distribution**
- Prices vary widely across different categories
- Distribution patterns differ by month
- Outliers present in multiple categories

**Finding 4: Data Integrity**
- Several columns have missing values requiring imputation
- Historical data availability varies by category

---

## Slide 8 — Visual Insights

**Correlation Heatmap Results:**
- Weak relationships between monthly price points
- External factors likely more important than historical trends

**Distribution Analysis:**
- Wide variation in price ranges across categories
- Some categories show bimodal distributions
- Seasonal patterns evident in monthly comparisons

**Bar Chart Analysis:**
- TAD category dominates in February prices
- Pipeline-based categories show competitive pricing
- Import/export prices differ significantly

---

## Slide 9 — Conclusion
**Key Takeaways:**
- Gasoline price increases driven primarily by external supply/demand factors, not historical prices
- Seasonal trends play a significant role in price volatility
- Multiple categories and refinery operations affect overall pricing

**Implications:**
- Refinery operations adjustments could help stabilize seasonal prices
- Predictive models must incorporate external variables (crude oil, supply, demand)
- Strategic inventory management during peak seasons could reduce price spikes

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate crude oil price data
- Develop regression models with external variables
- Build time-series forecasting model
- Analyze impact of policy interventions
- Test predictions on future data
