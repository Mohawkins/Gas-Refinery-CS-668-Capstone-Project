* Abstract: This research forecasts the gasoline price in U.S. and analyzes its managerial
implications by means of both univariate and multivariate time series forecasting
models. Gasoline price forecast is among the most difficulty time series variables
during its importance to the economy and extremely volatile nature. The average
regular gasoline price in U.S. reached $5.06 per gallon in the month of June 2022,
as opposed to $3.41 at the beginning of 2022, a 48% increase. While gasoline prices
had been rising over the first half of 2022 due to supply chain disruptions as a result
of global Covid 19 lockdowns and the Russia invasion of Ukraine since February
24, 2022, they then surprisingly came down in the second half of 2022 to $3.85 in
November 2022, which has caught many consumers and business organizations offguard. Both univariate time series forecasting models, such as exponential
smoothing and autoregressive integrated moving average, and multivariate time
series forecasting models, such as time series regression models, are used in this
research with the data for the period January 2002 through November 2022. We
find that the time series regression model with trend, season, GDP, CPI, and crude
oil price turns out the be the best forecasting model both on the training data and
the testing data, even with the testing data containing significant turning points.
Managerial implications and future research directions are also discusse

* Research Question: How can we prevent the refinery from raising gas prices above $4.00?
                     What can we do to persuade the United States Environmental Protection
                    Agency to look into the refinery’s decision not to switch during the winter season? 


* Dataset: This a U.S Natural Gas dataset that provide monthly summary of gas costs across the supple chain.  
           The dataset is available here:  https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_dcu_nus_m.htm

* Methodology: crude oil is located in regions that have been prone historically to political upheaval or have had their oil production disrupted due to political events. Several major oil price shocks have occurred at the same time as supply disruptions triggered by political events, most notably the Arab Oil Embargo in 1973-74, the Iranian revolution and Iran-Iraq war in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and Persian Gulf War in 1990. More recently, disruptions to supply (or curbs on potential development of resources) from political events have been seen in Nigeria, Venezuela, Russia, Iraq, Iran, and Libya.

* The chart plots the quarterly average crude oil price in real 2022 dollars per barrel over time.

     * X-axis: Time, represented by quarters (e.g., 1Q 1970, 4Q 2024).

     * Y-axis: Quarterly Average Crude Oil Price in real 2022 dollars, ranging from $0 to over $175 per barrel.

* Data Series: The gray line represents the price, specifically showing the West Texas 
  Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price and the Imported refiner acquisition cost of crude
  oil. Since they are plotted as a single line, they track each other closely.
